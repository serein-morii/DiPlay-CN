/**
 * Keeps the head unit's audio clock in step with the iPhone's during music (#610).
 *
 * The iPhone sends music at its own 48 kHz and the head unit plays it at its own. A Humax BHCN-T3103C played
 * 0.76 % fast, so the 300 ms start buffer ran dry about every 70 s and music paused while it refilled. After
 * each write the renderer reports how many frames are queued; a slow average of that level drives a PI
 * controller that, once a second, trims the track's playback rate so the level stays at the start threshold.
 * The trim is bounded by [MAX_TRIM] (26 cents at most) and settles at the head unit's own drift, which is a
 * hardware constant, so the next music stream starts from the trim this one learned.
